summary: |
  The Google Marketplace is the place where users can find and install third-party applications that are integrated with Google Workspace.
  The way GCP project enters a "pending deletion" state when deleted, could allow threat actors to make a malicious application to be invisible and unremovable.
  This could allow attackers access to sensitive information such as private Gmail correspondences, personal files and planned events within the the victim's google account.

  It is recommended that users go to the "Apps with access to you account" page and verify that they are familiar with all authorized third-party apps, and that each has the minimal needed permissions.
